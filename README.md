# SPDC-REST-API
The app is using three API controllers. Those are Accounts, Products, &amp; Orders. The names suggest what interaction they are going to handle. When the app is connected to the server through the enterprise integrator, all will be forwarded to the server except one special case, that is the payment handling scenario.
